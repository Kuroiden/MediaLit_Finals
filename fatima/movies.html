		<center><h1>Movies' Inspiration from Video Games</h1></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">
			Video games inspired different areas of media, including movies. Who wouldn’t be excited and amazed if their favorite video game character is going to have a film and can be watched on the big screen. It is undeniable that seeing our childhood hero from our favorite video games goes into the big screen gives huge amounts of adrenalin rush that makes us smile and remember our good old days. Seeing them move and do the action without us controlling them gives us the thought,’’ what are the lives of these characters outside the game’’ since we are going how they live and watching them will make us understand their own perspective. It is truly amazing that different film producers give life to these characters and make them the inspiration of one big art.

			As stated by Knox (2022), video games such as League of Legends are increasingly being used as a form of advertising for movies. Studios use gaming engines to create teaser trailers and even complete movie experiences for players to enjoy before the release of a film. This gives the audience a sample of the film's content. Many computer games are currently available on the big screen and television. In contrast, several successful computer games, such as League of Legends, originated from a film or television series. The blending of the two genres has not always been successful. Yet, it offers great potential for the future entertainment sector. Due to the parallels between the computer screen and the large screen, the transition occurs more frequently. This facilitates the construction of a sturdy bridge. Arguably the most significant resemblance between cinema and games, which is contributing to increased trade between the two genres, is the entertainment value provided by visually appealing imagery. Long and graphically demanding cinematic scenes have been a staple of modern computer games for quite some time. The advent of computer technology has made it possible to include high-quality, almost-realistic movie sequences.

			According to the website PressBooks (2016), The increase in the number of film adaptations of video games parallels the aging of video game players. Mortal Kombat, a live-action film based on the video game, earned more than $70 million at the box office in 1995, placing it 22nd for the year (Box Office Mojo). Angelina Jolie starred in the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, which debuted at No. 1 at the box office and ranked 15th overall for the year (Box Office Mojo). Films based on video games are becoming more common at the box office, such as Jerry Bruckheimer's Prince of Persia and the recent sequel to Tron, which is based on the concept of a virtual gaming arena. The marketing and reception of video game releases is a further facet of the effect of video games on film. Grand Theft Auto IV's release date was revealed and marketed to compete with Iron Man's. Supposedly, Grand Theft Auto IV outsold Iron Man by $300 million dollars. This comparison is misleading in certain respects. As video games are far more expensive than movie tickets, larger sales may not necessarily indicate that more individuals purchased video games over movies. Also, the distribution mechanism for the two media is entirely unlike. Movies may only be released in cinemas, whereas video games may be sold in retail establishments (Associated Press, 2008). However, this type of news report demonstrates that the public views video games as compared to films. It is also essential to understand that the size of production and profit for video games is comparable to that of motion pictures. Major game expenditures reflect the fact that video games feature music soundtracks, actors, and directors in addition to the game creators. Grand Theft Auto IV's production reportedly costs $100 million (Bowditch, 2008).

			Films and Video games are two major sources of entertainment for different individuals. These two areas combined for one great piece of art is remarkable since it will bring everyone joy and help them remember their childhood. Making video game-inspired movies is one great decision for some producers to earn customers satisfaction in the film industry. It is important for film producers that when they are making movies out of different video games, they keep the essence of characters on how different individuals knew them as a video game characters. It is good to tell their story without changing the things they can do or what they are capable of.
